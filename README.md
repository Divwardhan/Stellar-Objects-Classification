# ML Stellar Classification

## Overview
This project applies machine learning techniques to classify stellar objects using various classification models, including Decision Trees, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Support Vector Machines (SVM). The dataset is preprocessed and analyzed using Pandas and NumPy, with visualization support from Matplotlib and Seaborn.

## Features
- Data preprocessing (scaling, encoding, and splitting)
- Classification using multiple ML models
- Performance evaluation using cross-validation and classification reports
- Visualization of results with Seaborn and Matplotlib

## Installation
Ensure you have Python installed, then install the required dependencies:

```sh
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn xgboost seaborn matplotlib
```

## Usage
Run the Jupyter Notebook to process the data and train models:

```sh
jupyter notebook MLStellar.ipynb
```

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
